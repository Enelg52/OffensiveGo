# OffensiveGo - Golang Weaponization for your malwares.

This repo that contains some examples of offensives tools & utilities that can be used in a red team engagement rewrote in Golang. This project is also a way to train me to golang.

## Previous work :

These repo inspires me to make [OffensiveGo](https://github.com/RistBS/OffensiveGo)

- https://github.com/trickster0/OffensiveRust : Made by [trickster012](https://twitter.com/trickster012), this projects contains a bunch of example made in Rust

## About Golang

- **Simpler syntax**: Go's syntax is simpler and easier to learn compared to Rust, which has a steeper learning curve.
- **Garbage collection**: Go uses garbage collection, which makes memory management easier for developers. Rust, on the other hand, uses a borrow checker to enforce memory safety, which can be more difficult to work with.
- **Cross-platform support**: Go has excellent cross-platform support and can be compiled to run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Rust also has good cross-platform support, but its compilation process can be more complex.

### Golang Installation


`go build` for compilation 

Go binaries generally have no installation dependencies, compiler statically links Go runtime and needed packages. Static linking results in larger binaries
