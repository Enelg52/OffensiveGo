This repo that contains some examples of offensives tools & utilities that can be used in a red team engagement rewrote in Golang. This project is also a way to train me to golang.

## Previous work :

These repo inspires me to make [OffensiveGo](https://github.com/RistBS/OffensiveGo)

- https://github.com/trickster0/OffensiveRust : Made by [trickster012](https://twitter.com/trickster012), this projects contains a bunch of example made in Rust
- https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim : 


## About Golang

- **Simpler syntax**: Go's syntax is simpler and easier to learn compared to Rust, which has a steeper learning curve.
- **Garbage collection**: Go uses garbage collection, which makes memory management easier for developers. Rust, on the other hand, uses a borrow checker to enforce memory safety, which can be more difficult to work with.
- **Cross-platform support**: Go has excellent cross-platform support and can be compiled to run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Rust also has good cross-platform support, but its compilation process can be more complex.

## Interesting Tools in Golang

- [BananaPhone](https://github.com/C-Sto/BananaPhone) : An easy to use GO variant of [Hells gate](https://github.com/am0nsec/HellsGate) with automatic SSN parsing.
- [SourcePoint](https://github.com/Tylous/SourcePoint) : C2 profile generator for Cobalt Strike command and control servers designed to ensure evasion by reducing the Indicators of Compromise IoCs.
- [ScareCrow](https://github.com/optiv/ScareCrow) : Payload creation framework designed around EDR bypass such as AMSI & ETW Bypass, Encryption, Stealth Process Injections ect...
- [Freeze](https://github.com/optiv/Freeze) : Payload toolkit for bypassing EDRs using suspended processes, direct syscalls, and alternative execution methods.
- [Mangle](https://github.com/optiv/Mangle) : A tool that manipulates aspects of compiled executables (.exe or DLL) to avoid detection from EDRs.
- [Dent](https://github.com/optiv/Dent) : A framework for creating COM-based bypasses utilizing vulnerabilities in Microsoft's WDAPT sensors.
- [Ivy](https://github.com/optiv/Ivy) : Payload creation framework for the execution of arbitrary VBA (macro) source code directly in memory. Ivyâ€™s loader does this by utilizing programmatical access in the VBA object environment to load, decrypt and execute shellcode.

### Golang Installation


`go build` for compilation 

Go binaries generally have no installation dependencies, compiler statically links Go runtime and needed packages. Static linking results in larger binaries
