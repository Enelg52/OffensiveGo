## Previous work

These repo inspires me to make [OffensiveGo](https://github.com/RistBS/OffensiveGo)

- [OffensiveRust](https://github.com/trickster0/OffensiveRust) : Made by [trickster012](https://twitter.com/trickster012), this project contains a bunch of examples made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- [OffensiveNim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim) : Made by [byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r), this one contains examples written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).


## About Golang

- **Simpler syntax**: Go's syntax is simpler and easier to learn.
- **Garbage collection**: Go uses garbage collection, which makes memory management easier for developers.
- **Cross-platform support**: Go has excellent cross-platform support and can be compiled to run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Rust also has good cross-platform support, but its compilation process can be more complex.
- **Goroutine**:  Goroutines are lightweight threads of execution that enable concurrent programming in Go, making it easy to write efficient, safe, and scalable concurrent programs, allowing for non-blocking concurrent execution and communication via channels.

**OPSEC Consideration & Caveats of Golang**

Go binaries generally have no installation dependencies, compiler statically links Go runtime and needed packages. Static linking results in larger binaries. 2 MB for "Hello World" compared to 54 KB in C.


### Compilation

`go build` for compilation 

- go build -ldflags="-s -w" file.go
- Hide console, to avoid Go program displaying console windows on execution : `go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui rshell.go`
